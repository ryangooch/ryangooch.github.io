My New Year's Resolution in 2017 was to do exactly this. So I'm done right? I can rest on my laurels and coast through to 2018! Well, not quite. The idea was to build a simple blog where I could post the projects that I'm working on, professionally to an allowable extent, and personally to the full extent. My goal is about a post a week, so if you're looking at something here that you like, remember to check back in a week for a new post. 

Some of the things that you will see here include data scraping, databases, machine learning, python, and R, with planned projects involving the seeding of NCAA March Madness tournament brackets, determination of the safest (and least safe) roads to travel in the US, the most impactful locations to find specific jobs, and many more! So sit back and enjoy the ride.

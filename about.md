Ryan likes to stay busy. He currently has a few roles, primarily as a Graduate Research Assistant at Colorado State University, secondarily as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, Tutor, and Data Scientist for occasional contracts.

I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kentucky, and followed that up a few years later with an M.S. in E.E. My master's thesis research developed an automated, machine learning based behavior detection system for mice in lab settings. I continued that work in a professional capacity for Signal Solutions, before embarking on a Ph.D. in E.E. at Colorado State University. 

My goal is to become a professional Data Scientist, and this site serves in part as a portfolio of my work, and a record of my improvement in various capacities as a result of these projects.

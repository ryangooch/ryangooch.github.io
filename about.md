Ryan likes to stay busy. He currently has a few roles, primarily as a Graduate Research Assistant at Colorado State University, secondarily as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, Tutor, and Data Scientist for occasional contracts.

Ryan received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kentucky, and followed that up a few years later with an M.S. in E.E. His master's thesis research developed an automated, machine learning based behavior detection system for mice in lab settings. He continued that work in a professional capacity for Signal Solutions, before embarking on a Ph.D. in E.E. at Colorado State University. 

His goal is to become a professional Data Scientist, and this site serves in part as a portfolio of his work, and a record of his improvement in various capacities as a result of these projects.

## Project Summary

I compiled a dataset of graduate research assistant salaries from 85 public and private universities in the United States, along with living wage data for each university location. I discovered that in general, average grad student pay at these universities did not correlate closely with living wage in their areas.

## What's The Problem?

I started thinking about this a few weeks ago, but it appears that no consideration was made in my graduate assistant salary for the cost of living in my town, Fort Collins, CO. For years there has been a trend in this city, and others in Colorado, of people moving in from other areas, far more than those leaving. It makes sense. Colorado is an amazing place to live for so many reasons; natural beauty, healthy residents, 300 days of sun, and the list goes on. This has put some unpleasant pressures on the economy, however, in two very significant ways. The influx of people was so great that the residency vacancy rate plummeted, killing the supply of open houses, and raising home and property prices immensely.

For example, according to [biggerpockets.com](https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2016/02/11/most-and-least-vacancies-us-cities/), Fort Collins had the second lowest vacancy rate in 2016, with only 0.2% of residences open. This drop in supply caused prices to skyrocket. Fort Collins median home prices have risen by more than 50% in the past 10 years, and are continuing to rise. On the other hand, the influx of people has put pressure on the job market, as qualified candidates have flooded the area and inboxes of recruiters. This spoiling for choice has led to an extremely competitive job market, while salaries have no pressure to rise.

But this isn't a post about the woes of the Fort Collinsian economy. This is a post about graduate research assistant (GRA) salaries and the living wage. Basically, I wanted to know if GRA wages in the US tracked with the living wage, and to determine where GRA's have the best and worst deals relative to the area costs of living.

## Some Notes on the Methods
The living wage I'm using comes from [MIT](http://livingwage.mit.edu/), and is the work of Dr. Amy K. Glasmeier. It appears to be a pretty comprehensive attempt at estimating this quantity with a surprisingly fine geospatial granularity in the US. Dr. Glasmeier is careful to make the distinction between living wage and poverty wage. Essentially, the living wage seeks to find the basic required salary needed for an individual or family to meet their basic needs without relying on public assistance. The User Guide from the site puts it thus:

>The living wage is the minimum income standard that, if met, draws a very fine line
between the financial independence of the working poor and the need to seek out public
assistance or suffer consistent and severe housing and food insecurity. In light of this fact, the
living wage is perhaps better defined as a minimum subsistence wage for persons living in the
United States.
